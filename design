You

Produce a set of design documents for the digital solution that you are proposing. The design documentation must include: • Visual/interface designs • Data requirements • A selection of algorithm designs (maximum of five) • A test strategy Your proposed solution must be of sufficient scope and complexity to demonstrate the ability to implement code in at least two appropriate languages to implement front-end and back-end processes. Your design documents should be of sufficient detail to: • effectively communicate the intended solution to both technical and non-technical stakeholders • allow the client to make informed decisions • allow a third-party developer to use the design documents to create the proposed solution. Your algorithm designs do not need to show the whole solution but should show how you would solve a number of different key problems. You should limit your algorithm designs to a maximum of five complex problems. Your test strategy does not need detail specific tests for every part of the solution but should provide a selection of tests, as relevant to your proposed solution, that show: • the order in which you intend to test all components of the solution • the types of tests to be carried out for each of the components
