2.2 Data Flow Diagram
User Registration/Login: User data flows from the front end to the backend for authentication.
Product Search: User queries the product database, and results are returned to the front end.
Carbon Footprint Calculation: User inputs data, which is processed to generate results.
Appointment Scheduling: User selects a date, which is stored in the appointment database.
3. Algorithm Designs
3.1 User Authentication Algorithm
python
Run
Copy code
def authenticate_user(email, password):
    user = database.get_user_by_email(email)
    if user and verify_password(password, user.password):
        return generate_session_token(user.id)
    else:
        return None
3.2 Carbon Footprint Calculation Algorithm
python
Run
Copy code
def calculate_carbon_footprint(energy_usage, transportation_habits, waste_management):
    footprint = (energy_usage * 0.5) + (transportation_habits * 0.3) + (waste_management * 0.2)
    return footprint
3.3 Product Search Algorithm
python
Run
Copy code
def search_products(query):
    results = []
    for product in database.get_all_products():
        if query.lower() in product.name.lower() or query.lower() in product.description.lower():
            results.append(product)
    return results
3.4 Appointment Scheduling Algorithm
python
Run
Copy code
def schedule_appointment(user_id, service_type, date, time):
    if not is_time_slot_available(date, time):
        return "Time slot not available"
    appointment = Appointment(user_id=user_id, service_type=service_type, date=date, time=time)
    database.save(appointment)
    return "Appointment scheduled successfully"
3.5 Energy Usage Tracking Algorithm
python
Run
Copy code
def track_energy_usage(user_id, usage_data):
    user = database.get_user(user_id)
    user.energy_usage.append(usage_data)
    database.update_user(user)
    return user.energy_usage
4. Test Strategy
4.1 Testing Order
Unit Testing: Test individual components and algorithms.
Integration Testing: Test interactions between components (e.g., user authentication with the database).
System Testing: Test the entire application for functionality and performance.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Gather feedback from a group of end-users to validate the solution.
4.2 Types of Tests - Unit Tests: Validate the functionality of individual algorithms and methods, ensuring they return expected results for given inputs.
Integration Tests: Check the interaction between different modules, such as user authentication and database operations, to ensure they work together seamlessly.
Functional Tests: Assess specific functionalities of the application, such as the carbon footprint calculator and appointment scheduling, to confirm they meet requirements.
Performance Tests: Measure the application's response times and resource usage under various load conditions to ensure it meets performance benchmarks.
Security Tests: Evaluate the application for vulnerabilities, ensuring data protection measures are effective and user data is secure.
By following this structured approach to testing, the development team can ensure that the Customer Engagement Portal is robust, user-friendly, and meets the needs of Rolsa Technologies and its customers.
